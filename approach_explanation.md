# Approach Explanation: Intelligent Document Analyst

## Methodology Overview

Our solution implements a multi-stage pipeline that combines traditional NLP techniques with domain-specific heuristics to extract and prioritize relevant document sections based on persona and job requirements.

## Core Components

### 1. Document Processing
We extend the PDF parsing capabilities from Challenge 1A, focusing on section identification through:
- Font size and formatting analysis for heading detection
- Pattern matching for common section structures (numbered headings, chapter markers)
- Content aggregation under identified section headers

### 2. Content Analysis
The system employs TF-IDF vectorization to understand content semantics:
- Extracts key terms and concepts from each section
- Calculates relevance scores based on keyword matching with job requirements
- Assesses content quality through length, structure, and information density metrics

### 3. Persona-Aware Scoring
A specialized scoring mechanism tailored to different persona types:
- **Researchers**: Prioritizes methodology, findings, and literature references
- **Students**: Emphasizes concepts, definitions, and foundational knowledge
- **Analysts**: Focuses on data, trends, and performance metrics

### 4. Job-to-be-Done Matching
Dynamic keyword extraction from job descriptions enables flexible matching:
- Identifies task-specific terminology and requirements
- Weights sections based on alignment with stated objectives
- Adapts to diverse job types (literature review, exam prep, business analysis)

### 5. Section Prioritization
A weighted scoring system combines multiple factors:
- Content relevance (30%)
- Persona alignment (30%)
- Job requirement matching (30%)
- Content quality (10%)

## Technical Optimizations

- **CPU-Only Operation**: Uses scikit-learn's efficient TF-IDF implementation
- **Memory Management**: Processes documents sequentially to minimize memory footprint
- **Model Size**: Relies on lightweight statistical methods rather than large language models
- **Processing Speed**: Optimized text processing and vectorization for sub-60-second execution

## Scalability and Generalization

The solution generalizes across domains through:
- Domain-agnostic section detection algorithms
- Flexible persona and job matching frameworks
- Configurable scoring weights for different use cases
- Robust fallback mechanisms for edge cases

This approach balances accuracy with computational efficiency, ensuring reliable performance across diverse document types and user requirements while meeting strict resource constraints.
